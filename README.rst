Education Sprint - PyconUK 2012
===============================

What do you think students should learn?
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

* How to think like a computer scientist.
** "Sir" isn't always right or know the answer.
** Problem solving.
** CS Unplugged.
** Cultural shift from Teachers PoV.
* Teamwork - programming is not just a solo activity.
* Programming is a creative process that is fun.
* Patience.
* It's not MAGIC.
* Computers only do what you tell them to.
* Documentation (explain your code, show your working). RTFM! Know where to look. **Autonomy FTW!**.
* It's not that hard! :-) Scratch your itch (solve your problems).
* How to access, query and understand data (opportunity for x-curriculum collaboration).

What do you think teachers need to know in order to teach programming?
======================================================================

* A programmming language (but how much)
* A place to look up reference material and resources (to know where to get second level support).
* Understand the free-culture/creative commons outlook (to **be** [not have] part of a community).
* Where to ask for help (IRC, teacheroverflow.com, stackexchange.com, computingplusplus.org, STEM etc...)

Project Ideas for Schools
=========================

* Pygame Games
* Pyweek
* Raspberry Jam
* Turbine recording data into a RPi.
* Beep Beep
* Text based adventure games ftw!
* Dojo :-)
